/**
 * Idle limb motion — the baseline "this patient is alive" movement.
 *
 * LifeSigns used to sway the whole model root, but rotating the root pivots a
 * supine body through its support surface, so it was reduced to a no-op. That
 * left non-ambulatory patients (every seated, supine and recovery case — i.e.
 * most of them) with a chest morph and eye saccades as their ONLY movement:
 * the arms sat perfectly still, which reads as a mannequin, not a person.
 *
 * This module produces small LOCAL bone offsets instead, so the patient stays
 * planted on the floor/stretcher and attached equipment keeps its anchor:
 *
 *   • Shoulder lift  — coupled to the real breathing clock, and scaled by the
 *     respiratory rate. Applied to Mixamo *Shoulder* bones (the girdle), not
 *     the upper-arm bones: rotating LeftArm/RightArm levers the hands through
 *     a 30 mm arc and reads as jitter, especially on a tripod patient whose
 *     hands should stay planted on the knees.
 *   • Arm / forearm drift — two incommensurate sines per side so unbraced
 *     limbs settle and resettle instead of holding one frozen pose. Off while
 *     the patient is braced (tripod / hard accessory use): still arms plus a
 *     heaving chest is the finding, not a garnish sway.
 *
 * Amplitudes are radians and intentionally tiny — this should register as
 * "alive" in peripheral vision, never as a gesture.
 *
 * Pure + allocation-free (fills a caller-owned `out`), same discipline as
 * `computePatientMotionSignals`.
